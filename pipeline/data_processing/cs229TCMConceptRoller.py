"""
Owner: Ethan

Combines all datasets and then performs matrix multiplication to scale from 0-1 how important each feature is.

This script takes the symptom features and the location/coordinate features and 
combines them to create a new feature matrix where each syndrome is represented by 
the presence or absence of concepts derived from the symptoms.
Essentially, combining the symptom features with the location and coordinate features 
to create a new representation of the syndromes in terms of the underlying concepts.

Relevant files:
- Final_Training_Features_Syndrome_Symptom.csv: The original symptom features for each syndrome.
- Symptom_Location_Features.csv: The location features for each symptom.
- SMTS_eight_principles_by_id.csv: The coordinate features for each symptom.
