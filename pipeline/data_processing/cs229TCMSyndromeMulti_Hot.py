"""
Owner: Ethan

Creates a multi-hot encoded feature set for syndromes based on their associated symptoms. 
Each row represents a syndrome, and each column represents a symptom. 
A value of 1 indicates the presence of the symptom in the syndrome, while a value of 0 indicates its absence. 
The resulting dataset is saved as "pipeline/data/processed/Final_Training_Features_Syndrome_Symptom.csv".
