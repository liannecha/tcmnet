Extract data from the SymMap website, which contains information about the relationships between symptoms, 
syndromes, and herbs in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). 

The data is stored in JSON format on the website, and we used regexes to extract it. 

We used this to create Symptom_Syndrome_Edges.csv and Syndrome_Herb_Edges.csv.
