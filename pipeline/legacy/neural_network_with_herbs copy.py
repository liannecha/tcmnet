"""
Additional herb recommendation section

Instead of the dot product approach, we now use the herb head inside the model to recommend herbs.
The herb head scores each herb by concatenating the patient embedding with that herb's known concept
features (location + eight principles) and passing through a small mlp, so the model can learn
non-linear interactions between what the patient needs and what each herb provides.

We take the top-5 herbs by predicted probability from the herb head.
-> k = 5 (returns top 5 scores)
