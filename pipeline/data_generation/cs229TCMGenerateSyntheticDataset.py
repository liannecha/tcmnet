"""
Owner: Ethan

Generates a synthetic dataset of patients using a context aware strategy, 
where we use the compatibility scores between symptoms and concepts to guide 
the generation of new symptoms for each syndrome. This ensures that the synthetic patients 
we generate are plausible and consistent with the underlying TCM theory, rather than 
just randomly adding symptoms which may not make sense together. 

We also drop some existing symptoms with a certain probability to make it more 
realistic and less likely to just learn the original dataset. The resulting synthetic 
dataset can be used to train our model and improve its generalisation performance.
